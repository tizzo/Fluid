# Fluid #

Mobile is the new focus of a lot of attention and many Drupal themes are
cropping up with a focus on making responsive designs easier.  This theme was
created as a demonstration that responsive design is easy to implement.  The
[Fluid](http://github.com/tizzo/fluid) theme is comprised of nothing but an
info file and a layout.css file (just like Drupal core's stark theme).

Fluid is an experiment to create a bare bones Drupal 7 theme with a fully
functional responive layout built built with [media query](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/)
based break points to keep the layout friendly to displays of all sizes
(including mobile). Experimenting with Fluid requires
[Compass](http://compass-style) and [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net).
